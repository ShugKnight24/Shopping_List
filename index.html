          <p>Are you the type of person who struggles in a grocery store? Have you ever walked in to buy something specfic and walked out with more items than you anticipated? Fear not! Statistics that don't exist and cannot be verified say that you are not alone.</p>

        <div id="collapse2">
          <p>Does that resonate with you? If it doesn't, you are just far superior to the rest of us and you may leave this web app. If it does, I have dedicated my life to helping people like yourself.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Something Else</h2>
        <div id="collapse3">
        <p>Shopping can be difficult, lists make things easier. Shopping + List = The greatest technological innovation we have <b>EVER!</b> encountered.</p>
