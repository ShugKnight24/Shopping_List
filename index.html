        <h1>The Shopping List App</h1>
        <h2>The Shopping List Vision</h2>
        <div id="collapse1">
          <p>Are you the type of person who struggles in a grocery store? Have you ever walked in to buy something specfic and walked out with more items than you anticipated? Fear not! Statistics that don't exist and cannot be verified say that you are not alone.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <div id="collapse2">
          <p>Does that resonate with you? If it doesn't, you are just far superior to the rest of us and you may leave this web app. If it does, I have dedicated my life to helping people like yourself.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>The Premise</h2>
        <div id="collapse3">
        <p>Shopping can be difficult, lists make things easier. Shopping + List = perhaps the greatest technological innovation since <b>sliced bread!</b>(Which you can ironically purchase thanks to this brilliant technological breakthrough!)</p>
        </div>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <div id="collapse4">
        <p>I have created a form that you can use to enter the food you would like to purchase (from our predetermined list). You enter the prices for those items in your area, and my program will do all of the work. It will add up those items for you, create a list, and generate a total from our brilliant algorithms database!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="shoppingForm"
        <fieldset>
        <h1>Shopping Made Simple!</h1>
        <h3>Items to Purchase:</h3>
          <label class="food" for="text">Type in the food you want to purchase:</label>
          <input id="food" type="text" name="foodToAdd"/>
          <button type="button" onClick="#placeholder">Submit</button>
        <h3>Food Price</h3>
          <label class="price" for="number">Type in the price of the item:</label>
          <input id="price" type="text" name="priceToAdd"/>
          <button type="button" onClick="#placeholder">Submit</button>
